# Workflow Incubator Project Proposal
This is a proposal for setting up a new working group dedicated to workflows and orchestrations using OAS.

## Draft Proposal (Submit PR to Update)
Once this is finished we will submit as a Github issue for review by the Technical Oversight Board (TOB).

### Overview

* Name of project (must be unique within OAI): __Call Sequences and Dependancies__


* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history): 
    Definition of the specific requirements across more than one API call.
    
Being able to express specific sequences of calls and the dependencies between them in order to achieve a particular goal is desirable in the context of API specification. So an extension to the current OAI is proposed to allow sequences of calls and their dependencies to be expressed in the context of delivering a particular outcome or set of outcomes.  This work is inspired by the need to store sequences of calls in the context of specific tests and in order to communicate the particulars of a complex set of security related calls using OAuth2 and the Financial-grade API security profile of OpenID Connect.
